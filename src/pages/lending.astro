        AmicBridge for Lenders – A Safer Way to Grow Your Capital
      </h2>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        At <strong>AmicBridge</strong>, we help capital find purpose. Our network connects people who want to lend responsibly
        with borrowers who have been independently reviewed and verified by our internal compliance team.
        We are not a bank; we are a <strong>trust infrastructure</strong>—a private network that ensures both sides of a loan
        are genuine, transparent, and aligned.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Every borrower who joins AmicBridge passes through a <strong>multi-step verification process</strong>.
        We confirm identity, validate financial intent, and review supporting documentation before allowing any introduction.
        Only once that process is complete do we create a private contact channel between lender and borrower.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This gives you full control over your lending decisions, while knowing that each opportunity has been screened
        for authenticity. Lending through AmicBridge means your capital continues to work for you—helping real people
        while maintaining professional standards of discretion and safety.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Our focus is to protect your trust first, and your growth naturally follows. You remain in command of your money;
        we make sure every connection you make is worth it.

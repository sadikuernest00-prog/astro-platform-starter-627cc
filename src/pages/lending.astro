  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    At <strong>AmicBridge</strong>, we believe lending should be more than numbers on a screen —
    it should be a human connection built on trust, responsibility, and shared opportunity.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Many people have extra capital sitting in banks or investments that feel distant and impersonal.
    AmicBridge offers a different path: a <strong>private, verified network</strong> where individuals can lend
    directly to real people and small businesses who have been carefully screened and approved.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    We don’t handle your money — you stay in full control. Our role is to <strong>create the bridge</strong>:
    a safe, transparent space where trustworthy borrowers and responsible lenders meet.
    Every potential borrower goes through a <strong>strict verification process</strong> — we confirm their identity,
    purpose, and repayment intent before we introduce them to anyone.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    When you lend through AmicBridge, you can see exactly who you’re helping and why.
    You’re not sending your money into a system — you’re giving it direction, purpose, and impact.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    We help your money <strong>grow through lending that matters</strong> — supporting genuine needs,
    empowering people, and creating new opportunities where trust becomes the real currency.

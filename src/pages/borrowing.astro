        AmicBridge for Borrowers – Connecting You with Real Lenders
      </h1>

      <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-12 text-center">
        AmicBridge helps you connect directly with real, verified lenders who understand your
        situation and can offer terms that work for you — not the other way around.  
        We don’t act as a bank or take fees from your loan; instead, we provide a secure and
        private network where trust and transparency come first.
      </p>

        <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 max-w-md mx-auto">
          To join as a borrower, you’ll go through a simple, secure verification process.
          This includes confirming your ID and validating your payment documentation.
          Once approved, you’ll gain private access to our network of responsible lenders
          who can review your request and connect directly with you.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-600 mb-8 max-w-md mx-auto">
          Each introduction is handled discreetly — ensuring both sides are genuine,
          respectful, and aligned on terms that make sense for you.
        </p>
